{"name":"Simulatorzombies","tagline":"Mac application to count Xcode zombie processes","body":"SimulatorZombies\r\n================\r\n\r\nMac application to count Xcode zombie processes.\r\n\r\nOS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and XCode have a bug that creates a Zombie process every time you build, run, \r\nand exit an iOS application in the iOS Simulator. There is no way to kill these processes, so eventually \r\nthe system's maximum process limit is hit. The only way to clean this up is to reboot.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye on your zombie count with notifications and an easy to read status window. Share your zombie counts with your friends on Twitter and Facebook with the built in NSSharingServicePicker.\r\n\r\nThis app requires Mountain Lion and Xcode 4.5+, mostly because that's the only combination that is causing the bug.\r\n\r\nI've chosen to distribute this as source only, because if you're not writing code all day in Xcode then you probably don't give a care about this app.\r\n\r\nI'd love a cool icon for the app, or any other code contributions. Email ben@rigas.net if you like it!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
